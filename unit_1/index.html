		<h1>To See or Not To See</h1>
		<p>Your guide to the latest movies: letting you know what you should rush to see in theaters, which ones you should wait until it is available for Redbox, what movies will make you regret your life decisions if you attempt to watch them.</p>
		<h2>Black Mass</h2>
		<h3>Rush to the Theater</h3>
		<p>It is great to see Johnny Depp out of the quintessential "quirky" role that he has seemed to be placed in for the past 10 years or so. Being based on a true story, it was nice to see that they kept a lot of the story the same, not like more drama would need to be added in the first place. This is a movie about Whitey Bulger, after all. There were a lot of great, gruesome killings and liberal use of the "F" word. Basically, you've got yourself a great, true story mafia film set mostly in South Boston. Definitely worth the watch and the money to see.</p>
		<h2>The Visit</h2>
		<h3>Wait for Redbox</h3>
		<p>Being an M. Night Shyamalan film, you're never sure what to expect. The characters seemed well thought out, which is a plus. However, the classic Shyamalan twist was not a surprise. With all the hints they ellude to throughout the film, you start realizing that they've given away the major plot without telling you yet. So when it does happen, you feel almost let down. Definitely not a horrible movie, but I wouldn't spend more than a couple of bucks seeing it.</p>
		<h2>Fantastic Four</h2>
		<h3>You'll Regret Your Life Decisions</h3>
		<p>If you're a fan of the Fantastic Four comic book characters, turn away from this movie immediately. Not even the star status of the actors playing the lead roles could save this film. The storyline? Subpar. The editing? Atrocious. Relationship between the characters? Non-exsistent. Do not waste your time. Do not regret all your life choices by seeing this movie.</p>
